Django - Sveltekit - auth.js sample repo
-----------------------------------------

This repo contains a frontend built with sveltekit that connects to
a django backend for authentication. It is able to signin with both
django's built in user accounts and with oauth platforms.

The example provides some different buttons and pages that offer various techniques
to protect pages and data.

To run, you will need to provide the necessary environment variables and initialize the
sqlite database. to use social auth, those providers should also be added to django via the
admin interface.

This repo was built as a proof of concept, please feel free to create an issue if you're unable
to get it working!
